Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on extracting insights and knowledge from structured
and unstructured data. It combines techniques from statistics, mathematics, and computer science to analyze
data and draw meaningful conclusions. As organizations increasingly rely on data-driven decision-making,
the demand for skilled data scientists has surged. Data Science encompasses various processes, including data
collection, cleaning, exploration, analysis, and visualization, allowing businesses to make informed decisions
and identify trends.
Python has emerged as one of the leading programming languages in the field of Data Science due to its
simplicity, versatility, and a rich ecosystem of libraries. Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib
provide powerful tools for data manipulation, numerical analysis, and visualization.
Here are some of the essential libraries in Python that are widely used in Data Science, along with their
purposes and typical usage scenarios.
